## Summary

My research focuses on applying techniques from statistics, computer science, and operations research to solve hard problems, often with uncertainty. Currently, I primarily focus on developing methods for election integrity and auditing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Topic: "High-Level Modelling and Solving for Online, Real-Time, and Multiagent Combinatorial Optimisation"\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supervisors: Guido Tack, Peter J. Stuckey, Maria Garcia de la Banda, Andreas Schutt.

2018 - BSc + MSc in Computer Science. Uppsala University, Sweden.
